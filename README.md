# Brain-Tumour-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-CNNs-and-MR-Imaging
This project uses deep learning to classify brain MRI images into four types: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor. A CNN model built with TensorFlow processes the images to detect and categorize tumors. The goal is to improve medical diagnosis by automating brain tumor identification.
